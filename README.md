# AES-and-Des-hybrid-encryption-algorithm-
This algorithm is implemented for mobile applications since it is much more efficience in encrypting than original AES algorithm.
This algorithm has AES structure but instead of mix column step it has permutation table from DES algorithm."Test.py" file shows how to encrypt an image using this algorithm
